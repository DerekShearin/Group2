Project 02 Requirements
The group project must meet the following requirements:
  •	Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.
    o	A RESTful API is an architectural style for an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to access and use data. That data can be used to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data types, which refers to the reading, updating, creating and deleting of operations concerning resources.

•	Use a template engine such as Handlebars.js.
    o	A template engine enables you to use static template files in your application. At runtime, the template engine replaces variables in a template file with actual values, and transforms the template into an HTML file sent to the client. This approach makes it easier to design an HTML page.
    o	Some popular template engines that work with Express are Pug, Mustache, and EJS. The Express application generator uses Jade as its default, but it also supports several others.
    o	See Template Engines (Express wiki) for a list of template engines you can use with Express. See also Comparing JavaScript Templating Engines: Jade, Mustache, Dust and More.

•	Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.
    o	ORM= Object Relational Mapping
    o	MySQL: is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS).[5][6] Its name is a combination of "My", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter,[7] and "SQL", the abbreviation for Structured Query Language. A relational database organizes data into one or more data tables in which data types may be related to each other; these relations help structure the data. SQL is a language programmers use to create, modify and extract data from the relational database, as well as control user access to the database. In addition to relational databases and SQL, an RDBMS like MySQL works with an operating system to implement a relational database in a computer's storage system, manages users, allows for network access and facilitates testing database integrity and creation of backups.
    
•	Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.
  o	GET:Send request to server for information
  o	POST: Adding Information (data) to the server/UPLOAD

•	Deploy using Heroku (with data).

•	Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we haven't discussed

•	Have a polished UI

•	Be responsive. 
    o	(Viewable on Smart phone/tablet)
•	Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
•	Must have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.
   o	MVC= Model View Controller
•	Must include authentication (cookies and express-session).
•	Must protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.
•	Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
•	Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
•	Finally, you must add your project to the portfolio that you created in Module 2.
